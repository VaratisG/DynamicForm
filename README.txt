These two files are different versions of the demo task for Founderhood

The DemoTask#1 lets the user create his own form and then once he submits
the data in the fields, they get saved in a table, the next submit overwrites the data
of the first submit. So, everytime there are only the data of one person on the table.

The DemoTask#2 is an improved version of the previous one. The improvement is that 
it can save data from more than one submits. The table works as a temporary database as
the session is still on.
